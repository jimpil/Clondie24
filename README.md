Clondie24
=========

Blondie24 goes Functional!

This is an attempt to re-create Blondie24 [1], the computer program that learnt to play checkers on its own (by evolutionary means). At the moment I 've got the basic structures for the game (the board, the pieces and moving the pieces) and next comes creating the rules for the game and after that I will need some of sort of minimax/alpha-beta algorithm for doing the recursion. Now that clojure-encog [2] is around I can easily hook up the neural net and the genetic algorithm at the end... 


This is work in progress... I wouldn't even call it version 0.0.1!
